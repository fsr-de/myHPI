# tenca-django

This app is used for the management of mailing lists.

It is adapted from the [tenca-django implementation in 1327](https://github.com/fsr-de/1327/tree/master/_1327/tenca_django), originally implemented by @jeriox, @tzwenn, @Paula-Kli, @T4rikA and @SilvanVerhoeven.

To enable mailing list management set the `ENABLE_MAILING_LISTS` setting to True in your .env file.
Mailing lists can be managed by admins within wagtail. Mailing list owners can also manage mailing lists on the website.
