This tool is used to manage the student representative website at https://myhpi.de. It is a CMS based on Wagtail/Django and adds several functionalities like polls.

## Development setup

For a quick start, use the [dev container](https://containers.dev/), e.g. by installing the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in Visual Studio Code or using the [built-in feature in JetBrains IDEs](https://jetbrains.com/help/idea/connect-to-devcontainer.html). This automatically installs all dependencies in a container. After starting the container, setup your local data by following the Manual Setup from step 9 (creating a superuser).

### Manual setup

To set up a development version on your local machine, you need to execute the following steps:

1. Check out repository and cd to it
1. Set up a virtualenv for the project with Python >=3.11 and activate it (e.g., `python3 -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`)
1. Install poetry (if not already installed): `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org/ | python -`
1. Install dependencies with `poetry install`
1. Create env file by copying the `.env.example` file to `.env`, e.g. `cp .env.example .env` (Notice that for some functionality like OIDC some settings must be changed)
1. Migrate the database with `python manage.py migrate`
1. Install bootstrap with `python tools/install_bootstrap.py`
1. Optionally: Compile translations with `python manage.py compilemessages -i venv` (does not work on Windows, recommended to skip this step or see [docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/translation/#gettext-on-windows))
1. Optionally: Create test data with `python manage.py create_test_data`
1. Create a local superuser with `python manage.py createsuperuser`
1. Start the development server with `python manage.py runserver`
1. Open your web browser, visit `http://localhost:8000/admin` and log in with the user you just created

### Tests

Test the code with `python manage.py test myhpi.tests`.

### Code style

#### Pre-commit hook

We recommend installing a pre-commit hook with `pre-commit install`. The [hook](.pre-commit-config.yaml) will do the following steps before every commit:

- run `autoflake` with a couple of flags to remove unused imports,
- run `isort .` to sort imports,
- run `black .` to format the python code
- run `djlint-reformat-django --quiet` and `djlint-django` to format and lint template files (`html`) according to the `pyproject.toml` configuration
- run `prettier-eslint --write --list-different` to format the JavaScript code, (S)CSS, Markdown and YAML files according to the `.prettierrc` configuration

If you want to do that manually, run `pre-commit run --all-files`. Next to that, we also run `pylint myhpi` to check for semantic issues in the code.

#### IDE support

To get optional linting-related warnings within your IDE and format files when saving them, follow these steps:

- Install IDE plugins
  - black ([IDE integrations](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html))
  - djLint ([VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monosans.djlint))
  - Prettier ([IDE integrations](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors))
- Set configuration
  - Linting and formatting are already configured by the `.prettierrc` and `pyproject.tml` files which are also used by the [pre-commit hook](#pre-commit-hook)
  - You still have to write IDE-specific configuration to e.g. enable formatting on save and assign file types to the correct plugin
    - Find configuration examples for IDEs below

##### Configuration in VSCode

Workspace settings:

```
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter",
  "[javascript][css][scss][markdown][yaml]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
  "[html]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "monosans.djlint"
  },
}
```

## Tips

- To create translations: Run `python manage.py makemessages -l de -i venv`. Fill in the translations in `django.po`. Apply changes by running `python manage.py compilemessages -i venv`.

### Reset database

1. Delete `db.sqlite3`
2. Conduct development setup steps 7+
